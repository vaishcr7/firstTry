3. Make 3 new commits in master from Git UI 
4. Merge these new branch changes to master branchMerge&Master // branchMaster added from Git UI & new branch merge

Following steps:
Now making 2nd test commit 

This step now merging the mergeTutorial changes after pulling the latest code in master (as made 3 new commits in Git UI after creating the new branch ). Therefore, the 2 new branch commits should be after 3 new UI commits of master. 

Now changing same line from new branch and master to see which gets applied on top.
